overnight progressive prosecutor chessa boudin getting ousted from office he

lost his job yesterday san francisco voters recalling the soft on crime

district attorney joining us now the man who led that effort richie greenberg

good morning richie morning from san francisco i haven't

slept since yesterday morning i'm all caffeinated let's go i'm sure you are i

know you're excited i mean this race was called by the ap an hour after polls

closed he won he the voters decided 60 of the voters said

you are out how do you feel this morning you know um it's a bittersweet victory

and the reason is because people died businesses have been destroyed families

have been uprooted it's it's it's a victory but i'm not going to be uh you

know uh popping any champagne bottles because

this is a recall that should never have had to be done joseph bodine should

never have been elected he was never qualified to do this and so ousting him

with this effort that is a basically a a year and a half in the making to bring

it to the finish line last night you know it was really tough this is

something that um we really didn't want to have to do i mean if it's happening

in san francisco you know it's really bad his policies must be really bad

because i know san francisco is so liberal how is it affecting the tourism

industry because some some people are saying oh let's go

take a trip to napa oh no no no i don't want to stay in san francisco are there

hotels in the napa area it had to have affected tourism because of the homeless

population and all the crime yeah absolutely you hit it right on the

head you know the tourism industry here in san

francisco is a major uh you know tax uh base how how the the government can

function by the hotel tax and the spending by tourists uh businesses and

so it's been decimated and it still hasn't come back there's uh

years away is what they're projecting before it could potentially come back

uh and now with uh bodine out i don't know i shouldn't even call him d.a

bodine anymore right with bodine out

we look forward to the mayor appointing an actual prosecutor who's going to hold

criminals accountable london breed has to appoint a new d.a is there pressure

on her now to make sure she appoints someone who is more conservative and

really focused on crime well yeah of course

you know we've gone two and a half years under bodine who basically never left

the public defenders side that's where he came from he was he had no experience

as a prosecutor he got elected and we've been sitting here floundering for two

and a half years without a real prosecutor so i am absolutely confident

that london breed is going to appoint a real prosecutor who do you think will be

appointed is there someone that that is in the works someone being talked to

about this position so there's three or four individuals

that have been uh the names have been floated uh we have one of the um

one of the opponents that ran against uh bodine back in 2019 nancy tong we have

um uh who else we've got um oh yeah uh

we've got um brooke jenkins who is a one of the employees that worked under

bodine uh who

very very capable people um and a couple of others but the point is anyone that

she that she chooses for sure is going to be an actual prosecutor and

experienced prosecutor and is going to return normalcy to the da's office well

richie you had a movement to save san francisco and it looks like you did we

hope that things are cleaned up there in your city so that we can all visit thank
